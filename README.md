# smart-gloves-for-wheelchairs
The smart gloves have the potential to improve user mobility and independence. By utilizing hand gestures, individuals can perform various actions such as acceleration, braking, and turning, enabling them to navigate their environment more effectively. 


# Introduction

The proposed accelerometer-based smart gloves for wheelchairs
offer a cost-effective and intuitive solution for enhanced
mobility. By utilizing accelerometer sensors for hand gesture
recognition, the system provides individuals with physical
disabilities a means to control their wheelchairs effectively.
These features are then used to recognize specific gestures,
allowing the wheelchair to respond accordingly. The
development of the system focuses on designing an efficient
gesture recognition algorithm that can accurately interpret the
accelerometer data in real-time
